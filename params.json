{"name":"IDES Data Preparation - OpenSSL","tagline":"Decrypting notifications received from IDES with OpenSSL","body":"## IDES Data Preparation\r\n\r\nThe International Data Exchange Service (IDES) is a secure managed file transfer service that allows financial institutions and tax authorities to securely send information on financial accounts held by U.S. taxpayers in accordance with the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Files transmitted via IDES must be encrypted and packaged in accordance with published data preparation instructions. The data preparation process is an important step to ensure that information transmitted via IDES conforms to U.S security standards to safeguard sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThe IDES Data Preparation OpenSSL project repository demonstrates the commands necessary to decrypt notifications downloaded from the IDES portal. The included commands are Windows specific, Linux specific, and a process that includes manual editing that will work for those and other systems.\r\n\r\nThe sample commands are intended to be run from a batch file located along with the OpenSSL executable, the Key and Payload files from the notification, and the receiver's private key. \r\n\r\nPlease note that there are many open market tools that produce the same results; however, the IRS does not endorse any commercial products, including the frameworks used in the example. \r\n\r\n### Windows Batch Scripting\r\n\r\nThe following code should be placed into a batch file and run in the same folder as the openssl executable. \r\n\r\nThe following files are required and the filename in the batch script will need to be replaced with your filename for each:\r\nKEYFILE - this is the Key file that will be in the downloaded notification .zip file\r\nPRIVATEKEY - this will be your private key that corresponds to the certificate that was uploaded into IDES\r\nPAYLOAD - this is the Payload file that will be in the downloaded notification .zip file\r\n\r\nThe first command will decrypt the AES key. The batch code will parse the hex values of the AES key and prepare it for the second command. The second command will use the AES key in hex format and decrypt the Payload file. The output will be the decrypted Payload .zip file.\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nopenssl rsautl -decrypt -hexdump -in KEYFILE -inkey PRIVATEKEY -out aeskey.txt\r\n\r\nset /p firstline=< aeskey.txt  \r\nSet line1=%firstline%     \r\nset result1=%line1:~7,48%                           \r\n\r\nSetlocal EnableDelayedExpansion\r\nfor /f \"tokens=* delims= \" %%i in (aeskey.txt) do (\r\nset var=%%i\r\n)\r\nset result2=!var:~7,48!  \r\n\r\nset result1=%result1: =%\r\nset result1=%result1:-=%\r\nset result1=%result1:~0,32%\r\nset result2=%result2: =%\r\nset result2=%result2:-=%\r\nset result2=%result2:~0,32%\r\nset combined=%result1%%result2%\r\n\r\nopenssl aes-256-ecb -d -in PAYLOAD -out PAYLOAD.zip -K %combined%\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n \r\n\r\nRunning the batch file:\r\n![Image 1](http://irsgov.github.io/IDES-Data-Preparation-OpenSSL/images/image11.png)\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\n### Manual OpenSSL Commands\r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble with an automated method above, there are additional steps you can take to decrypt the AES key, manually get the required hex key data, and use it to decrypt the Payload file. \r\n\r\nThe process is similar to the automated method above. The following files are required and the filename in the batch script will need to be replaced with your filename for each:\r\nKEYFILE - this is the Key file that will be in the downloaded notification .zip file\r\nPRIVATEKEY - this will be your private key that corresponds to the certificate that was uploaded into IDES\r\nPAYLOAD - this is the Payload file that will be in the downloaded notification .zip file\r\n\r\nThe following code should be run in the same folder as the openssl executable and necessary files.\r\n\r\nDecrypting the AES key:\r\n![Image 2](http://irsgov.github.io/IDES-Data-Preparation-OpenSSL/images/image1.png)\r\nFigure 2\r\n\r\nThe hexdump flag in the command above will output the key in hexadecimal format which is needed to decrypt the Payload file. However, there is extra information that is included that needs to be removed before it can be used in the next command. You can use a text editor to open the aeskey.txt file which is the output of the first command.\r\n\r\nExample Hex data in Notepad++:\r\n![Image 3](http://irsgov.github.io/IDES-Data-Preparation-OpenSSL/images/image2.png)\r\nFigure 3\r\n\r\nExample Hex data in Notepad:\r\n![Image 4](http://irsgov.github.io/IDES-Data-Preparation-OpenSSL/images/image3.png)\r\nFigure 4\r\n\r\nThe hex content that is needed from the file is highlighted below. The rest of the information needs to be removed. \r\n0000 - <span style=\"background-color: #FFFF00\">e0 a8 fc 55 88 72 3d 5f-24 0f e4 7f 39 42 df a9</span>   ...U.r=_$...9B..\r\n0010 - c4 34 ab 26 bb b2 dc 20-65 59 d7 14 cd b0 15 47   .4.&... eY.....G\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
